# Introduction üí°
Best fit is a memory management algorithm. Its operation consists of allocating the block in the smallest space that is big enough in that block. This algorithm is a little slow as it has to make several comparisons, but it prevents many errors.

# About üìò
The project was created to simulate best fit algorithm. This is just for demonstration, it's an easy and visually implementation. If you want to see a real implementation you can take a look at [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus-program-for-best-fit-algorithm-in-memory-management).

Some important things:
-  Memory is represented by a list of 100 elements
- -1 represents a free space in memory;
- Other number represents the process's id
- Each process can be created with random sizes
- The program creates always two process and after choose a random process to erase
- When a process is allocated, the program do some verifications to allocate in the best place

# Objetives üìã

> Demonstrate how best fit algorithm works

# How Works üë®‚Äçüè´

1. We have two list that represents memories- VRAM and RAM
```python
vram = []
ram = [-1 ] * 10
```
VRAM is infinite, so we don't need to define the start value. But RAM is not, so we defined that RAM has 10 spaces (You can change if you want).

2. We random create some process with a random number of pages with random number of size (You can change if you want).
```python
  number_of_process = randint(1,3)
  for process_id in range(number_of_process):
    process = []
    pages = randint(1,5)
    for page in range(pages):
      size = randint(1,3)
      process.append([process_id , page, size])
      print(f' Process: {process_id}; Page: {page}; Size: {size}')
    vram.append(process)
```

3. We need to create de mapping and add to the RAM.
```python
  for index, value in enumerate(vram):
    mapping = []
    for process in value:
      frame_number = randint(number_of_process+1, len(ram)-1)
      mapping.append([process[1], frame_number])
      print(f'Process {index} page {process[1]} mapped at frame {frame_number}')
    ram[index] = mapping
```

4. And after setting up all these things we can finally simulate the paging
 - First we try to allocate the process into RAM  
```python
in_process = True
  while(in_process):
    for process_index, process in enumerate(vram):
      for page_index, page in enumerate(process):
        if(page[2]!=0):
          mapping = ram[process_index][page_index]
          if(ram[mapping[1]]==-1):
            print(f'Process {page[0]}, page {page[1]}, position {mapping[1]} allocated')
            ram[mapping[1]] = page
            print(f'RAM: {ram}\n')
```
 - Second we need to decrease size of all process that are in RAM
```python
    for i in range(number_of_process, len(ram)):
      if(ram[i]!=-1):
        page = ram[i]
        page[2] = page[2] - 1
        if(page[2]<=0):
          print(f'Removed process {page[0]}, page {page[1]}, position {ram.index(ram[i])} because processing has finished')
          ram[i] = -1
          print(f'RAM: {ram}\n')
```
 - And finally we need to know if still has a process with size greater than 0, if it is, we try do more one loop, if it isn't we can finish the program
```python
    has_process = False
    for i in vram:
      for j in i:
        if(j[2]!=0):
          has_process = True
    
    if(not has_process):
      in_process = False
```

# Run Locally üìÇ
- You need to install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads) to run the program.

- Do a git clone

      git clone https://github.com/ofelipescherer/python-best-fit.git

- After you can run `paging.py`
